//! Ratchet for the size of `App`: counters that may only go down.
//!
//! `App` is the application's one object, and the panels are not functions that TAKE it - they are METHODS
//! ON it. That is the shape of the trouble, and it is worth spelling out because the first attempt to
//! measure it looked at the wrong thing: counting `&mut App` gave 245, of which 207 were test scaffolding
//! and the rest mostly test helpers. Panels never take `&mut App`; they take `&mut self`.
//!
//! While a panel is a method on `App` it CANNOT move to a crate of its own - a method belongs to the crate
//! that declares the type. And it does not have to say what it needs: `self` is everything at once, so the
//! reader cannot tell whether a panel touches the document, the camera or the status line without reading
//! its whole body.
//!
//! Three numbers say how far the untangling has got, all read from the source rather than declared:
//!
//! * `IMPL_APP_CEILING` - how many `impl App` blocks exist. Each one is a file reaching into the god object.
//! * `APP_METHODS_CEILING` - how many methods hang on `App`.
//! * `APP_SIZE_CEILING` - how big those blocks are, in word characters - a formatter does not move it.
//! * `APP_FIELDS_CEILING` - how many fields `App` carries.
//!
//! WHY EQUALITY AND NOT "NO MORE THAN". A pair of `<=` and `>=` was tried in the other ratchets and half of
//! it turned out to be dead: at a mark of zero nothing can fall below, so the `>=` could never fire while
//! looking exactly like a guard. `assert_eq!` holds both directions at any mark: growth is a regression, and
//! a drop asks for the mark to be lowered in the same commit - otherwise slack piles up silently.
