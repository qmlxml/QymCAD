//! A CRASH MUST NOT DISAPPEAR.
//!
//! There was no logging in this program at all - no logging crate, no panic hook - so a crash left
//! nothing behind: the window vanished and the person had a sentence to offer and no way to say what
//! the program was doing. A report like that costs a conversation and usually ends in "could not
//! reproduce".
//!
//! What is kept is what cannot be recovered afterwards:
//!
//! * the trail of actions, recorded WHEN AN OPERATION OPENS rather than when it commits. A crash
//!   happens in the middle of an operation, so a trail of committed steps is missing exactly the one
//!   that killed the program;
//! * the paths of the document and of its autosave - not the geometry. Copying a document out of a
//!   panic hook means serialising a model the hook cannot safely reach; the files are already on disk
//!   and the next start offers them;
//! * the build, the system, the place and the backtrace.
//!
//! THE HOOK NEVER PANICS ITSELF. Every step is fallible and every failure is swallowed: a panic inside
//! a panic hook aborts the process, and the person loses even the message the default hook prints.
